Random Story Generator ðŸŽ²ðŸ“–
A fun Python program that generates a short, random story each time you run it.
The program randomly selects elements like the time, character, location, and event to create a unique story.

Features
Randomly picks a time setting (e.g., "Yesterday", "A long time ago").

Randomly picks a character (e.g., "a rabbit", "a cat").

Randomly picks a name, location, and event.

Produces a different short story every run.

How It Works
The program contains predefined lists for:

when â†’ the time setting of the story.

who â†’ the main character type.

name â†’ the characterâ€™s name.

residence â†’ where the character lives.

went â†’ where the character goes.

happened â†’ what happens next.

The program uses random.choice() to pick one item from each list.

It combines them into a sentence and prints the story.
